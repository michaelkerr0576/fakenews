WORK IN PROGRESS:
Application is not running CRUD operations from MongoDB yet. All updates only exist in the DOM and are overwritten with the initial state when the page is refreshed. Check out the LatestNews component to see how adding, updating and delting articles will work. The overall feel of the site is there. The components just need to be made smart.

Note: Only "Build" in Client is committed to Heroku. Build contains the static files
