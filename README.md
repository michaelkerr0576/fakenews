> MERN Full Stack Application - Newspaper Website to show fake news

> **DEMO:** [https://fakenews01.herokuapp.com](https://fakenews01.herokuapp.com)

## Objective

To build a full stack newspaper application focused on typography.

## Overview

A user will be presented with a frontpage where they can read articles that are text only. A major goal was establishing a strong visual hierarchy without the use of colour or graphics. Instead the site relies on the typography and element spacing to hold the user's attention. The main components are the Headlines, Most Read and Latest News sections. A regular user can filter, sort and search for articles to read while an admin user can login and run CRUD operations to POST, PATCH AND DELETE articles.

## Motivation

**DESIGN:** 95% of the web content is typography. A good web designer should first focus this discipline before moving on to other web design components. No colour or images were used to show the significance of typography in front end development.

**LEARNING:** To build an app using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Node) from the ground up. To learn about state management with Redux.

## Tech Stack

Fakenews is created with:
- React
- Redux
- Node
