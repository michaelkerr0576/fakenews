            Local Man An Expert In The German League All Of A Sudden
          </h2>
          <h3 className="mb-3">
            STUDIOUS and prolific, Olympic-level bullshitter Conor Shellin has
            been given a new lease of life thanks to the behind-closed-doors
            return of the Bundesliga.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Decamped to his couch all weekend and mainlining hours of football
            after weeks of devastating withdrawals, Shellin was a hyperactive
            presence on WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram delivering stats, facts
            and opinions on German football to unfortunate friends and loved
            ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The loss of football had been presented Shellin with the chance to
            grow as a person and to not be a know-all statistician who bases his
            entire personality around the actions of millionaires kicking a
            ball, but kindly declined, plowing ahead instead with a deluge texts
            to friends containing wildly inaccurate statements and ‘hot takes’
            about German football.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Love the fan-ownership model in the Bumperliga, have always said
            that,” Shellin said repeating something he read on Twitter. “They
            say Haaland is the new Ibrahimovic, but he’s close to classic Van
            Basten or Original Ronaldo,” he added, just making it up as he went
            along.
          </p>
          <p>
            “All you German footy newbies looking for a team to support should
            follow Union Berlin, great history. The Gladbach team in the 70s,
            now there was a proper fucking team,” Shellin added into a WhatsApp
            group ‘Football Ladz’, routinely copying and pasting things from
            football forums.
          </p>
          <p>
            Far from calling Shellin out of on his spoofing, friends were
            supportive of his efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He just wasn’t the same without the football. It’s good to have the
            head-wrecking bullshitter we all know and love back,” confirmed one
            emotional friend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elsewhere, a survey of football fans asking their opinions on a
            potential Premier League return with no crowds have admitted the
            thing they’ll miss most about the match day experience is calling
            the referee a cunt in person.

            Emotional Scenes As Builders Wolf-Whistle For First Time In Two
            Months
          </h2>
          <h3 className="mb-3">
            THERE were emotional scenes in Dublin’s inner city as several women
            walking to work were greeted with wolf whistles emanating from a
            building site this morning.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sticking fingers in his mouth in a bid to make the loudest possible
            noise, teary eyed builder Martin Phelan cut through the misty
            morning air with a marvelous rendition of ‘swit swoo’, sending
            co-workers into impassioned applause to mark the first official
            wolf-whistle in several weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I just can’t put it into words,” safety officer on the site Darren
            Pierce broke down, the emotional moment, forcing him to heg
            uncontrollably like a young child, “and she even turned around and
            gave us a dirty look. We all just broke down crying”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Echoing his call, dozens more builders joined in the chorus, some
            even wolf-whistling at the men walking to work, proving how much
            Ireland has changed during the longest lockdown period since the big
            snow of ’18.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I decided I was a gay after spending three weeks in lockdown with
            the missus,” another brave wolf-whistling builder opened up, now
            also making a masturbation gesture at some worried looking man in a
            suit in a bid to get his attention, “I think our whole mindset has
            changed after all of this and I’m just glad to be back to work,
            doing what I do best, sexually harassing commuters on their way to
            work”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tabloid newspapers reported a huge surge in sales from this morning,
            while breakfast roll stocks jumped 25 points on the Dublin stock
            exchange.
